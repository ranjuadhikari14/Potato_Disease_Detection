# Potato_Disease_Detection

 Overview
This project aims to detect and classify potato plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning techniques. The goal is to assist farmers and agricultural researchers by providing a reliable and fast disease identification system.

Features
Automatic identification of common potato leaf diseases:
Early Blight
Late Blight
Healthy

Trained using convolutional neural networks (CNN)

Based on a public dataset (e.g., PlantVillage)

User-friendly interface (CLI or GUI)
Jupyter notebook & Python script support
